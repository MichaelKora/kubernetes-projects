    <h1>Kubernetes Deployment</h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>
        You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the
        desired
        state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing
        Deployments
        and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.
    </p>

    <h2>Updating a Deployment</h2>
    <p>
        A Deployment's rollout is triggered if and only if the Deployment's Pod template (that is, .spec.template) is
        changed, for example if the labels or container images of the template are updated. Other updates, such as
        scaling the Deployment, do not trigger a rollout.
