    <h1>Kubernetes Deployment </h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>
        You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the
        desired
        state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing
        Deployments
        and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.
