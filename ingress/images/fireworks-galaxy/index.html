    <h1>The Fireworks Galaxy</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        NGC 6946, sometimes referred to as the Fireworks Galaxy, is a face-on intermediate spiral galaxy with a small
        bright nucleus, whose location in the sky straddles the boundary between the northern constellations of Cepheus
        and Cygnus. Its distance from Earth is about 25.2 million light-years or 7.72 megaparsecs.

    <p>
        The Fireworks Galaxy is classified as an intermediate spiral galaxy, which means that it has a structure that is
        between that of an unbarred and barred spiral galaxy. Its spiral structure is quite irregular and it has unusual
        magnetic arms located between the optical ones.

        The galaxy has an apparent size of about 11.48 by 10.72 arcminutes in optical wavelengths, but appears
        considerably larger in radio wavelengths. The Uppsala General Catalogue of Galaxies (UGC) lists a major and
        minor axis of 14 arcminutes and a photographic magnitude of 10.5 for the galaxy.

    <h2>Supernovas</h2>

    <p>
        In the past century, eight supernovas have been observed to explode in the arms of this galaxy. Chandra
        observations (purple) have, in fact, revealed three of the oldest supernovas ever detected in X-rays, giving
        more credence to its nickname of the "Fireworks Galaxy. Ten supernovas were detected from 1917 to
        2017: SN 1917A, SN 1939C, SN 1948B, SN 1968D, SN 1969P, SN 1980K, SN 2002hh, SN 2004et, SN 2008S, and SN
        2017eaw.
