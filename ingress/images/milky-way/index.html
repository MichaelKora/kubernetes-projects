    <h1>The Milky Way</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The Milky Way is the galaxy we live in. A galaxy is a system of millions or billions of stars. They're all mixed
        together with gas and dust, and the whole lot is held together by gravity. As far as astronomers like me can
        tell, there are about one hundred billion galaxies in our Universe. There may be more that we just haven't been
        able to observe yet.

        The Milky Way contains between 100 and 400 billion stars. One of these is our Sun, which looks huge to us here
        on the ground, but is not even one of the biggest in the Milky Way. And the Milky Way is also nowhere near being
        the largest of the galaxies we know about.

    <h2> Shape </h2>

    <p>
        The Milky Way is shaped a bit like a Frisbee, with a bulge in the middle. This "space Frisbee" is really big:
        the diameter (the distance from one edge to the other) is a billion billion kilometres.

        It is hard to deal with numbers that big. So astronomers often use "light years" instead of kilometres to measure
        really big distances like the size of galaxies. A light year is the distance light would travel in a year. Light
        zips through space at 300 000 kilometres per second, so this makes the Milky Way just over 100 000 light years
        across.

        But it is also tough to imagine something that big. So let us think about it another way to help put it in
        perspective.

        If we shrank our whole solar system down to the size of a grain of sand, the diameter of the Milky Way would be
        about 50 kilometres.

        The thickness of the Milky Way's disk depends on where you are in the galaxy. It is thicker nearer the centre and
        gets thinner as you move out towards the edge. But on average it is 1000 light years thick.

        The stars in the Milky Way are not uniformly distributed in the disk, instead they are arranged in spiral arms
        stretched out from the bulge in the centre. The Earth is found in one of these spiral arms, about two thirds of
        the way out from the middle of the galaxy.
